# SQL_AutoParts_Catalog_Management

## Project Overview

This project is a complete, SQL-based aftermarket auto parts catalog system developed for both internal operations and external distribution. Designed in full alignment with **ACES and PIES** data standards, it transforms raw vehicle fitment and part data into two key outputs:

- A structured **Buyers Guide** covering precise vehicle-part application mapping

- A comprehensive **MasterCross**, which unifies OEM and aftermarket competitor part numbers for each part

I built this system to replace my companyâ€™s fragmented and manually maintained catalog with a **fully autonomous, scalable solution**. It enables structured updates using raw input tables maintained by the R&D teamâ€”streamlining the integration of new part introductions, vehicle fitments, and cross-reference relationships.

As a result, the catalogâ€™s **accuracy improved, manual workload decreased**, and **data sharing with sales teams and customers became significantly faster and more reliable.**

## Dataset Description

###  ACES/PIES Data Overview

The dataset for this project consists of two distinct yet interconnected components: the foundational **AAIA ACES/PIES** data, and company-specific catalog data. Each serves a unique purpose in creating a comprehensive automotive parts catalog.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ 1. AAIA ACES/PIES Data (Industry Standard)

The Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association (**AAIA**) provides standardized vehicle fitment and application data using the **ACES (Aftermarket Catalog Exchange Standard)** and **PIES (Product Information Exchange Standard)** frameworks. This foundational dataset includes:

- **Vehicle Identification and Attributes**  
  `Make`, `Model`, `Year`, `SubModel`, `BodyType`, `VehicleType`, `BodyNumDoors`, `DriveTypeName`, etc.

- **Engine and Performance Data**  
  `EngineBaseID`, `Liter`, `Cylinders`, `AspirationName`, `FuelTypeName`

- **Technical Specifications**  
  `TransmissionControlTypeName`, `SteeringSystemName`, `BrakeABSName`, `CylinderHeadTypeName`

This data ensures industry-wide consistency and compatibility, forming the base upon which the catalog is structured.

---

####  2. Company-Specific Catalog Data (Internally Generated)

On top of the ACES/PIES structure, Iâ€™ve augmented the dataset with company-specific part information tailored for our internal catalog system. This includes:

- **Product Identification**  
  `TSPARTID`, `TSPARTIDLR`, `AAIAPARTTERMINOLOGY`, `AAIAPOSITION`

- **Inventory and Localization**  
  `QUANTITY`, `MEXICO`, `CanK`

- **Fitment and Interchangeability Details**  
  `Opposite_Side_PARTID`, `Submodel_RockAuto`, `COMMENTS`, `DETAILS`

These fields provide the detailed part-level resolution needed to drive accurate Buyers Guide generation and SKU-to-vehicle mapping.

---

####  Why Combine AAIA and Company Data?

Merging these two data sources enables a powerful, dual-purpose catalog system:

- **Industry Alignment**  
  Maintains compatibility with external systems, buyers, and data-sharing partners using the AAIA standard.

- **Operational Precision**  
  Enhances internal accuracy in product mapping, inventory alignment, and vehicle fitment validation.

This hybrid dataset design lays the foundation for a scalable, autonomous, and high-integrity catalog system purpose-built for real-world use.

Building upon the ACES/PIES structure, I've integrated our company's specific part number information to generate our comprehensive raw catalog dataset. This augmented dataset is the cornerstone for the final catalog generation.

This enhanced dataset forms the backbone of the systemâ€”supporting precise vehicle fitment logic, structured catalog assembly, and rich Buyers Guide generation.

###  MasterCross Data Overview

In the automotive parts industryâ€”especially for manufacturers and wholesalersâ€”**accurate part identification** is critical. With a wide array of vehicle makes, models, and submodels (often varying by region), ensuring correct part-to-vehicle matching is essential for both operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) numbers serve as the industryâ€™s primary standard for part identification. However, in the aftermarket world, customers often request quotes using **OEM references** or **aftermarket competitor part numbers**. To respond effectively, sellers must maintain a detailed, organized system of cross-references that map each internal part to all available equivalent numbers across the market.

This comprehensive cross-referencing datasetâ€”often referred to as the **Master Cross**â€”enables:

-  Accurate customer quoting  
-  Faster catalog lookup and matching  
-  Seamless integration with third-party buyer systems  
-  Greater catalog integrity and internal data consistency

####  Original Challenge

Prior to this project, the Master Cross was managed **manually** in Microsoft Access. Each new part or cross-reference was entered by handâ€”resulting in inefficiencies, inconsistencies, and missed opportunities to automate key catalog processes.

To modernize this workflow, I first **unpivoted and normalized** the manually compiled table to extract only the relevant cross-reference information. This laid the foundation for building a clean, scalable structure where each part's crossesâ€”OEM and aftermarketâ€”could be properly grouped, analyzed, and exported.

>  *Note: This table has been simplified and pseudonymized to demonstrate the schema and logic only. The original dataset contains tens of thousands of crosses and brand mappings across over 15,000+ unique SKUs.*


By automating and structuring the Master Cross using SQL, I enabled my company to:

-  Eliminate repetitive manual entry  
-  Support scalable cross-reference expansion  
-  Export unified catalogs for clients, quotes, and internal systems

This Master Cross now functions as a **core component of our catalog logic**, linking each internal TSPARTID to a complete set of competitor and OEM numbers used across the industry.
