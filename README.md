# SQL_AutoParts_Catalog_Management

## Project Overview
This project delivers a complete, SQL-based aftermarket auto parts catalog designed for both internal operations and customer distribution. Built to align with industry standards such as the ACES and PIES data formats, it transforms raw vehicle fitment and part data into two essential outputs:

- A structured Buyers Guide for vehicle-part applications

- A comprehensive CrossMaster, which consolidates OEM and aftermarket competitor part numbers

The system was developed to modernize and streamline our company’s catalog infrastructure—replacing manual processes with an autonomous, scalable solution. It supports continuous updates by integrating raw input tables from R&D, enabling efficient tracking of new part introductions, vehicle fitments, and cross-references.
