# SQL_AutoParts_Catalog_Management

## Project Overview

This project is a complete, SQL-based aftermarket auto parts catalog system developed for both internal operations and external distribution. Designed in full alignment with **ACES and PIES** data standards, it transforms raw vehicle fitment and part data into two key outputs:

- A structured **Buyers Guide** covering precise vehicle-part application mapping

- A comprehensive **MasterCross**, which unifies OEM and aftermarket competitor part numbers for each part

I built this system to replace my company’s fragmented and manually maintained catalog with a **fully autonomous, scalable solution**. It enables structured updates using raw input tables maintained by the R&D team—streamlining the integration of new part introductions, vehicle fitments, and cross-reference relationships.

As a result, the catalog’s **accuracy improved, manual workload decreased**, and **data sharing with sales teams and customers became significantly faster and more reliable.**
