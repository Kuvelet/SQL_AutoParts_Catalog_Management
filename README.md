# SQL_AutoParts_Catalog_Management

## Project Overview

This project is a complete, SQL-based aftermarket auto parts catalog system developed for both internal operations and external distribution. Designed in full alignment with **ACES and PIES** data standards, it transforms raw vehicle fitment and part data into two key outputs:

- A structured **Buyers Guide** covering precise vehicle-part application mapping

- A comprehensive **MasterCross**, which unifies OEM and aftermarket competitor part numbers for each part

I built this system to replace my companyâ€™s fragmented and manually maintained catalog with a **fully autonomous, scalable solution**. It enables structured updates using raw input tables maintained by the R&D teamâ€”streamlining the integration of new part introductions, vehicle fitments, and cross-reference relationships.

As a result, the catalogâ€™s **accuracy improved, manual workload decreased**, and **data sharing with sales teams and customers became significantly faster and more reliable.**

## Dataset Description

###  ACES/PIES Data Overview

The dataset for this project consists of two distinct yet interconnected components: the foundational **AAIA ACES/PIES** data, and company-specific catalog data. Each serves a unique purpose in creating a comprehensive automotive parts catalog.

#### ðŸ”¹ 1. AAIA ACES/PIES Data (Industry Standard)

The Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association (**AAIA**) provides standardized vehicle fitment and application data using the **ACES (Aftermarket Catalog Exchange Standard)** and **PIES (Product Information Exchange Standard)** frameworks. This foundational dataset includes:

- **Vehicle Identification and Attributes**  
  `Make`, `Model`, `Year`, `SubModel`, `BodyType`, `VehicleType`, `BodyNumDoors`, `DriveTypeName`, etc.

- **Engine and Performance Data**  
  `EngineBaseID`, `Liter`, `Cylinders`, `AspirationName`, `FuelTypeName`

- **Technical Specifications**  
  `TransmissionControlTypeName`, `SteeringSystemName`, `BrakeABSName`, `CylinderHeadTypeName`

This data ensures industry-wide consistency and compatibility, forming the base upon which the catalog is structured.

####  2. Company-Specific Catalog Data (Internally Generated)

On top of the ACES/PIES structure, Iâ€™ve augmented the dataset with company-specific part information tailored for our internal catalog system. This includes:

- **Product Identification**  
  `TSPARTID`, `TSPARTIDLR`, `AAIAPARTTERMINOLOGY`, `AAIAPOSITION`

- **Inventory and Localization**  
  `QUANTITY`, `MEXICO`, `CanK`

- **Fitment and Interchangeability Details**  
  `Opposite_Side_PARTID`, `Submodel_RockAuto`, `COMMENTS`, `DETAILS`

These fields provide the detailed part-level resolution needed to drive accurate Buyers Guide generation and SKU-to-vehicle mapping.

####  Why Combine AAIA and Company Data?

Merging these two data sources enables a powerful, dual-purpose catalog system:

- **Industry Alignment**  
  Maintains compatibility with external systems, buyers, and data-sharing partners using the AAIA standard.

- **Operational Precision**  
  Enhances internal accuracy in product mapping, inventory alignment, and vehicle fitment validation.

This hybrid dataset design lays the foundation for a scalable, autonomous, and high-integrity catalog system purpose-built for real-world use.

**Sample ACES/PIES Data (1991 Nissan Pathfinder Example):**

| RegionID | Make | Model | Year | SubModel | VehicleType | FuelTypeName | DriveTypeName | TransmissionControlTypeName | BodyType | BodyNumDoors | BaseVehicleID | AspirationName | EngineBaseID | Liter | CC | CID | Cylinders | BlockType | SteeringSystemName | SteeringTypeName | VehicleID | BodyTypeID | BodyNumDoorsID | DriveTypeID | BrakeABSName | CylinderHeadTypeName |
|----------|------|-------|------|----------|-------------|--------------|---------------|-----------------------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|-------|----|-----|-----------|-----------|--------------------|------------------|-----------|------------|----------------|-------------|--------------|----------------------|

| MAKE | MODEL | BodyType | Year | SUBMODEL | VehicleType | BodyNumDoors | MfrBodyCode | YrMax | COMMENTS | DETAILS | AAIAPARTTERMINOLOGY | AAIAPOSITION | QUANTITY | TSPARTID | TSPARTIDLR | MEXICO | Liter | Cylinders | AspirationName | FuelTypeName | DriveTypeName | Submodel_RockAuto | CanK | Opposite_Side_PARTID |
|------|-------|----------|------|----------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------|----------|---------|--------------------|--------------|----------|----------|------------|--------|-------|-----------|----------------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|------|----------------------|
| Nissan | Pathfinder | Sport Utility | 1991 | SE | Truck | 4 | NULL | 1991 | NULL | NULL | Liftgate Lift Support | NULL | 2 | 611321 | 611321 | YES | 3.0 | 6 | Naturally Aspirated | GAS | 4WD | SE | YES | NULL |

This enhanced dataset forms the backbone of the systemâ€”supporting precise vehicle fitment logic, structured catalog assembly, and rich Buyers Guide generation.

###  MasterCross Data Overview

In the automotive parts industryâ€”especially for manufacturers and wholesalersâ€”**accurate part identification** is critical. With a wide array of vehicle makes, models, and submodels (often varying by region), ensuring correct part-to-vehicle matching is essential for both operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) numbers serve as the industryâ€™s primary standard for part identification. However, in the aftermarket world, customers often request quotes using **OEM references** or **aftermarket competitor part numbers**. To respond effectively, sellers must maintain a detailed, organized system of cross-references that map each internal part to all available equivalent numbers across the market.

This comprehensive cross-referencing datasetâ€”often referred to as the **Master Cross**â€”enables:

-  Accurate customer quoting  
-  Faster catalog lookup and matching  
-  Seamless integration with third-party buyer systems  
-  Greater catalog integrity and internal data consistency

####  Original Challenge

Prior to this project, the Master Cross was managed **manually** in Microsoft Access. Each new part or cross-reference was entered by handâ€”resulting in inefficiencies, inconsistencies, and missed opportunities to automate key catalog processes.

To modernize this workflow, I first **unpivoted and normalized** the manually compiled table to extract only the relevant cross-reference information. This laid the foundation for building a clean, scalable structure where each part's crossesâ€”OEM and aftermarketâ€”could be properly grouped, analyzed, and exported.

| TOYOTA | 53450-69045 | 5345069045   | 613593   | 613593     | 901393   | 461510     | 4326       | LS10116  | SG329011    | 013610  | 84326   | DMA       |             |       |
| TOYOTA | 53440-YC040 | 53440YC040   | 613593   | 613593     | 901393   | 461510     | 4326       | LS10116  | SG329011    | 013610  | 84326   | DMA       |             |       |
| TOYOTA | 53440-YC020 | 53440YC020   | 613593   | 613593     | 901393   | 461510     | 4326       | LS10116  | SG129032    | 013610  | 84326   | DMA       |             |       |

>  *Note: This table has been simplified and pseudonymized to demonstrate the schema and logic only. The original dataset contains tens of thousands of crosses and brand mappings across over 15,000+ unique SKUs.*


By automating and structuring the Master Cross using SQL, I enabled my company to:

-  Eliminate repetitive manual entry  
-  Support scalable cross-reference expansion  
-  Export unified catalogs for clients, quotes, and internal systems

This Master Cross now functions as a **core component of our catalog logic**, linking each internal TSPARTID to a complete set of competitor and OEM numbers used across the industry.

## Buyers Guide Construction & Cross Integration

To build a complete and distributable aftermarket catalog, I designed a two-stage process:

### Step 1: Build the Buyers Guide from Application Fitment Data

The Buyers Guide is constructed by transforming raw ACES-style application data into a structured format that maps each **vehicle configuration** to a specific **internal part number (TSPARTID)**.

This process includes:

-  Filtering out incomplete or deprecated entries
-  Grouping applications by year range, submodel, and body type
-  Ensuring 1-to-1 or 1-to-many relationships between part numbers and fitments
-  Formatting the output to match industry-exchange standards

This results in a **vehicle application table** with part IDs, ready to be enhanced with cross-references.

This SQL script builds a summarized application table for each unique `TSPARTID` (part number). It combines:

- Vehicle fitment information (make, model, year ranges)
- Body type formatting
- Position, quantity, and part terminology (based on AAIA standards)
- Comments and details
- A final SELECT that outputs a human-readable, enriched catalog row per part

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. `UniqueTSPARTID`
Gets all distinct part numbers from the source table `TUF_CATALOG_AAIA`. Serves as the anchor for joining later data.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. `ApplicationInfo`
Builds a vehicle fitment string for each part:

- If the part is labeled `UNIVERSAL`, returns 'Universal'.
- Otherwise, constructs grouped strings like:
  
  `Nissan: Pathfinder (1991â€“1992); Altima (1995â€“1998) / Toyota: Camry (2001â€“2004)`

This involves nested aggregation:
- First by `MAKE`, `MODEL`, `Year`
- Then grouped into brand-level fitment strings
- Then collapsed per part

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. `AggregatedBodyType`
Summarizes body configurations like:

`2 Door Coupe (1995â€“2001), 4 Door Sedan (2002â€“2004)`

- If only one year range: just show `2 Door Coupe`
- If multiple ranges per body type: add `(Yearâ€“Year)` for clarity

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. `AggregatedNotes`
Combines:
- Manufacturer body codes (`MfrBodyCode`)
- Comments (`COMMENTS`)
- Details (`DETAILS`)

Example output:

`ABC123 || Fits limited edition only || Reinforced bracket design`

Uses `STRING_AGG` and `TRIM` to format cleanly.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. `AggregatedTerminology`
Aggregates key AAIA-style catalog fields per part:
- `PartTerminology` (e.g., Lift Support)
- `Position` (e.g., Left, Right)
- `QuantityNeeded` (e.g., 1, 2)

Uses nested `DISTINCT` and `STRING_AGG` for clean deduplication.

---

### ðŸ§¾ Final SELECT

Returns a unified view with:
- `TSPARTID`
- `Application` string
- Min and max fitment years
- Body type string
- Position, terminology, and quantity
- Combined comments + codes + details in `Notes`

This final output is the basis of the Buyers Guide table or export.

### ðŸ”„ Step 2: Unpivot and Normalize the Master Cross Data

The original cross-reference table contained over 50 columns of competitor and OEM brands in a wide format. To make it usable:

- I **unpivoted the table** using SQL to convert all brand columns into rows
- Removed null, duplicate, and placeholder values
- Mapped each cross-reference to its corresponding `TSPARTID`
- Classified the source type (OEM, aftermarket, conditional, etc.)

This generated a **flat, normalized CrossMaster** table for easy joins and exports.


### ðŸ”— Step 3: Combine Buyers Guide with Master Cross

The final step is to **enrich the Buyers Guide** by joining it with the normalized CrossMaster using `TSPARTID` as the key.

This produces a catalog where each vehicle-part application is associated with:

- The internal part number (`TSPARTID`)
- All known OEM and aftermarket equivalent numbers
- Any opposite-side or regional variations

This structure supports **both internal lookup** and **external sharing** with customers, resellers, and catalog distributors.
